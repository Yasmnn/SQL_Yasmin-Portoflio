Data Analysis Portfolio Using SQL:
- Hotel Analysis - POSTGRESQL
  - Source of Raw Data: Kaggle ([International Hotel Booking Analytics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alperenmyung/international-hotel-booking-analytics))
  - I'm digging into some user reviews to find key insights, and i figure out a few things such as the average of overall score per year for each hotel, how many reviews each user_id has written, and what is the lowest and highest scores are. I'm also looking for the users who tend to give low scores most often.
  - If you're interested in the queries I wrote, feel free to check out my "hotel_analysis" file!
  
 - Coming Soon
